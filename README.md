# Project.07-ML_Capstone-Yes_Bank_Stock_closing_Prediction

Presenting to you is a ML capstone project on Yes Bank Stock Bank Prediction.

                  Yes-Bank is an Indian bank headquartered in Mumbai, India and was founded by Rana Kapoor and Ashok Kapoor in 2004. In Sept 2018 Rana Kapoor was accused in a fraud case. Thus this project is to study the pattern of stock prices before and after. We are also training the dataset to predict the stock prices.

                    Stock market is characterized as unpredictable and non-linear in nature.
In Order to perform our study, we have extracted the data from Yes Bank dataset and then categorized it into Independent and dependent features to analyze their behavior and pattern. We found some relevant analysis using ML- regression which helped us to predict the stock closing price of Yes Bank.

                      Features of dataset are as below:
Dataset of Yes Bank stock prices contains open, close, high and low prices of stock from July 2000– November 2020.
Our dataset contains 185 rows and 5 columns.
Date – it denotes the month and year for price.
Open- the price of stock when the stock market is open for the day.
Close- the price of stock when the stock market is closed for the day.
High- price of stock is maximum during the given time.
Low- price of stock is minimum during the given time.
                      In Addition to the regular EDA process we have added ML Programming to train the data. The models used are: -

Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
ElasticNet Regression

                      Throughout the project we learn many things such as problem statement, technical side of the ML model. We deal with open, close, high, low price as Yes bank dataset and learn how we predict the value of stocks by analysis of their previous performance.
